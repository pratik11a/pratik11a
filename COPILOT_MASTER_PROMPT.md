## Project: pratik11a Resume Website

### Coding Guidelines
- Use clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS for all UI changes.
- Keep the design minimal, professional, and mobile-friendly.
- Use SVG icons for contact and social links where possible.
- All email addresses should be clickable mailto links with an icon.
- Use accessible markup (e.g., alt text for images, proper heading structure).
- When adding new sections, follow the existing style and structure.
- All code should be well-formatted and commented where necessary.
- Do not expose sensitive information in the codebase.

### Copilot Agent Instructions
- Always check for manual edits before making changes.
- When updating the resume, preserve the overall layout and style.
- For new features, prefer progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
- Use only open-source or self-contained assets (no external dependencies unless approved).
- Commit messages should be clear and follow the format: `feat|fix|docs: <short description>`.
- After each significant change, commit and push to the main branch.

### Example Commit Message
